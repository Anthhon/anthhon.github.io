The HUGO work directory contains essential folders and files for building and deploying a website, including `archetypes` for template files, `config.toml` for configuration settings, `content` for Markdown content files, `layouts` for template files, `public` for final HTML files, and `static` for static files.

## Changing Website Content

To change the content of your website, you will need to modify the Markdown files in the `content/` directory. Each file represents a page or an article on your website. You can modify the text and the metadata at the top of the file.

To change the layout or design of your website, you will need to modify the templates in the `layouts/` directory. HUGO uses the Go templating language, which is similar to HTML but with additional functionality.

Once you have made your changes, you can use the hugo command to build your website. The resulting HTML files will be stored in the `public/` directory.
