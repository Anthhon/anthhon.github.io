    <h1 id="hi-im-anthony-silva">Hi i&rsquo;m <em>Anthony Silva</em></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 19-year-old Brazilian guy who has been fascinated
with computers for as long as I can remember. <strong>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in the &ldquo;hardware-close&rdquo;
software nerdy stuff.</strong> Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about sharing my knowledge (although I must admit,
I still have a lot to learn) and I think Github&rsquo;s free hosting website could be a great option.</p>
<h2 id="professional-career-and-passions">Professional career and <em>passions</em></h2>
<p>As for my programming background, I&rsquo;ve been at it for 2 years now and I&rsquo;m always looking for
ways to expand my knowledge. During this time, <strong>I mostly worked on projects related to management
systems for small companies.</strong><br>
<br>
However, <strong>I&rsquo;m also passionate about the low-level side of programming,</strong>
and I think that creating technical posts and related content would be an excellent way to share
what I know and maybe even help someone out. <strong>I consider myself a low-level developer and my go-to
language is C,</strong> and recently i&rsquo;m interested about Rust, but I also know a thing or two about front-end
development, because, let&rsquo;s face it, who doesn&rsquo;t these days? And in case you doesn&rsquo;t already know
<a href="https://github.com/Anthhon">that is my Github profile.</a> So&hellip; go check it out!</p>
