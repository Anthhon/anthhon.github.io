<p>First of all, this page was created with the aim of addressing
the problem of internet &ldquo;bloat&rdquo;. If you are a regular internet user,
<strong>you have probably noticed that many websites promise to provide certain
information or services but end up being cluttered with links and ads.</strong><br>
<br>
This can be frustrating, which is why I decided to do my part and create a
website that provides a clutter-free experience.<br>
<br>
On this website, <strong>I will write articles not only about technical low-level
content, but also about random topics that are related to the message I
want to convey to the world.</strong> If this website gains a large following, I
may consider moving it to a separate domain. However, for the time being,
we are sticking with what we have.<br>

<h2 id="is-this-project-going-to-be-open-source">Is this project going to be <em>open source?</em></h2>
<p>If you really want to write you own article, or maybe even improve something about the
code, you can indeed make a push request and <strong>would be a pleasure
to have contributors</strong> to the website.<br>
<br>
<strong>At first glance i&rsquo;m probably gonna be doing it like a private project,</strong> because
i thinks it&rsquo;s needed to first find the website &ldquo;identity&rdquo; as i would say.</p>
