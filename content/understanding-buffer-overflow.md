# *Overview*

Buffer Overflow is probably one of the oldest forms of vulnerabilities 
till the early days of computers, and besides that fact, isn't actually so hard 
to see this type of attack against newly-developed applications. Due to it's 
**complex nature and wide variety of techniques to be used,** it's actually hard 
to find buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\
\
**But if you think yourself as a developer it's 
almost your duty to know what is a Buffer Overflow and how to at least avoid it.**

## How it works

To know how it works it's required some knowledge about [how the heap and the 
stack works](../how-heap-and-stack-works) at low level.
