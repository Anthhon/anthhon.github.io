# What is The*Minimal*Coder?

First of all, this page was created with the aim of addressing 
the problem of internet "bloat". If you are a regular internet user, 
**you have probably noticed that many websites promise to provide certain 
information or services but end up being cluttered with links and ads.**\
\
This can be frustrating, which is why I decided to do my part and create a 
website that provides a clutter-free experience.\
\
On this website, **I will write articles not only about technical low-level 
content, but also about random topics that are related to the message I 
want to convey to the world.** If this website gains a large following, I 
may consider moving it to a separate domain. However, for the time being, 
we are sticking with what we have.\

## Is this project going to be *open source?*

If you really want to write you own article, or maybe even improve something about the 
code, you can indeed make a push request and **would be a pleasure 
to have contributors** to the website.\
\
**At first glance i'm probably gonna be doing it like a private project,** because 
i thinks it's needed to first find the website "identity" as i would say.
