# Hi i'm *Anthony Silva*

I'm a 19-year-old Brazilian guy who has been fascinated 
with computers for as long as I can remember. **I'm particularly interested in the "hardware-close" 
software nerdy stuff.** Lately, I've been thinking about sharing my knowledge (although I must admit, 
I still have a lot to learn) and I think Github's free hosting website could be a great option.

## Professional career and *passions*

As for my programming background, I've been at it for 2 years now and I'm always looking for 
ways to expand my knowledge. During this time, **I mostly worked on projects related to management 
systems for small companies.**\
\
However, **I'm also passionate about the low-level side of programming,** 
and I think that creating technical posts and related content would be an excellent way to share 
what I know and maybe even help someone out. **I consider myself a low-level developer and my go-to 
language is C,** and recently i'm interested about Rust, but I also know a thing or two about front-end 
development, because, let's face it, who doesn't these days? And in case you doesn't already know 
[that is my Github profile.](https://github.com/Anthhon) So... go check it out!
